Information Retrieval is a multidisciplinary field where knowledge from engineering andinformation theory is combined with media technologies, linguistics, or musicology to deal
with the variety of digitally available information. In the past two decades, even
neuroscience was involved, showing how brain activity can be used to control future IR
systems. The other way around, namely IR informing neuroscience, was only explored
starting in 2012. We used computational extraction of features from continuous digital
music to obtain time series variables that were related to the brain signal measured while
participants were listening to the music in a magnetic resonance scanner. Since then,
several other studies with other brain technologies were also conducted. This methodology
has been helpful to move from artificial stimulation paradigms, typically used in
neuroscience for maintaining control over manipulated variables, towards a naturalistic
paradigm where variables are both well controlled and closely matched to real-life
conditions. The potential of this naturalistic paradigm is becoming evident to the cognitive
neuroscience community, also in relation to clinical applications, although use of IR to
inform brain signals remains still mainly confined to music and sounds. Further avenues of
applications can be pursued by fostering new interdisciplinary contaminations.
