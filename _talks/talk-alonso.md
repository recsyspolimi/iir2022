There is a lot of interest in knowledge graphs as a rich structure that can be used in many IR applications like search, recommendations, and question-answering. While there are examples of knowledge graphs in industry and academia, there is little information on the practical aspects of design and construction. In this talk, we describe some of the challenges and opportunities when designing and implementing a domain-specific knowledge graph from the ground up.
