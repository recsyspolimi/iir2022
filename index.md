The purpose of the **Italian Information Retrieval Workshop** (**IIR**) is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Information Retrieval, where Italian researchers (especially young ones) and researchers affiliated with Italian institutions can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.
