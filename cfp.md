## Scope
The purpose of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop (IIR) is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Information Retrieval, where Italian researchers (especially young ones) and researchers affiliated with Italian institutions can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.

IIR 2022 is the 12th edition of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop. It will take place on June 29th - July 1st, 2022 and it is jointly organised by Politecnico di Milano (where it will take place on both June 29th and July 1st) and by the University of Milano Bicocca (where it will take place on June the 30th).

IIR 2022 aims to be an in-presence event. Nevertheless, on-line presentations and participation is allowed.

Participation to the IIR 2022 workshop will be free of charge. However, advance registration will be strictly required.

## Topics

IIR 2022 offers an opportunity to present and discuss both theoretical and empirical research. Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:

- **Search and Ranking.** Research on core IR algorithmic topics, including IR at scale, covering topics such as:  
  - Queries and query analysis  
  - Web search, including link analysis, sponsored search, search advertising, adversarial search and spam, and vertical search  
  - Retrieval models and ranking, including diversity and aggregated search  
  - Efficiency and scalability  
  - Theoretical models and foundations of information retrieval and access

- **Future Directions.** Research with theoretical or empirical contributions on new technical or social aspects of IR, especially in more speculative directions or with emerging technologies, covering topics such as:
  - Novel approaches to IR
  - Ethics, economics, and politics
  - Applications of search to social good
  - IR with new devices, including wearable computing, neuroinformatics, sensors, Internet-of-Things, vehicles

- **Domain-Specific Applications.** Research focusing on domain-specific IR challenges, covering topics such as:  
  - Social search
  - Search in structured data including email search and entity search
  - Multimedia search
  - Education
  - Legal
  - Health, including genomics and bioinformatics
  - Academic search
  - Other domains such as digital libraries, enterprise, news search, app search, archival search

- **Content Analysis, Recommendation and Classification.** Research focusing on recommender systems, rich content representations and content analysis, covering topics such as:
  - Filtering and recommender systems
  - Document representation
  - Content analysis and information extraction, including summarization, text representation, readability, sentiment analysis, and opinion mining
  - Cross- and multilingual search
  - Clustering, classification, and topic models

- **Artificial Intelligence, Semantics, and Dialog.** Research bridging AI and IR, especially toward deep semantics and dialog with intelligent agents, covering topics such as:
  - Question answering
  - Conversational systems and retrieval, including spoken language interfaces, dialog management systems, and intelligent chat systems
  - Semantics and knowledge graphs
  - Deep learning for IR, embeddings, and agents

- **Human Factors and Interfaces.** Research into user-centric aspects of IR, including user interfaces, behavior modeling, privacy, and interactive systems, covering topics such as:
  - Mining and modeling search activity, including user and task models, click models, log analysis, behavioral analysis, and attention modeling
  - Interactive and personalized search
  - Collaborative search, social tagging and crowdsourcing
  - Information privacy and security

- **Evaluation.** Research that focuses on the measurement and evaluation of IR systems, covering topics such as:
  - User-centered evaluation methods, including measures of user experience and performance, user engagement and search task design
  - Test collections and evaluation metrics, including the development of new test collections
  - Eye-tracking and physiological approaches, such as fMRI
  - Evaluation of novel information access tasks and systems such as multi-turn information access
  - Statistical methods and reproducibility issues in information retrieval evaluation


## Submissions
Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format in the CEUR-WS single-column conference format available at [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip).

Submission will be peer reviewed and accepted papers will appear in the CEUR workshop series (at authorsâ€™ discretion). 
Papers may range from theoretical works to system descriptions.
We particularly encourage PhD students or Early-Stage Researchers to submit their research. We also welcome contributions from the industry and papers describing ongoing funded projects which may result useful to the IIR community.   
The conference language is English.

Authors are invited to submit one of the following types of contributions:
* Full original papers (10 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed)
* Short original papers (5 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed)
* Extended abstracts containing descriptions of ongoing projects or presenting already published results (up to 4 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed). If presenting already published results the extended abstract should be single blind and contain a reference to the original published paper.

Submission will be through Easychair at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iir2022" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iir2022</a>.
