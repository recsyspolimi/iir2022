# About IIR

The Italian Information Retrieval (IIR) Workshop was created in 2009 by Massimo Melucci, Stefano Mizzaro, and Gabriella Pasi at the European Summer School in Information Retrieval (Padova, IT, 2009). The purpose of the IIR workshop has been to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Information Retrieval, where early-stage researchers can network and discuss their research results in an informal way. Since 2010, IIR grew thanks to the support and the cooperation of the community. IIR 2019 is the tenth edition of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop.
